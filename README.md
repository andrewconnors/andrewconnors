### Hi there üëã

## üöÄ About Me

üéì My name is Andrew Connors. I am a **Backend Engineer** who has dabbled in frontend work in the past. You can currently find me at Meta working to scale neural interfaces from research to production. Previous to that, I was at instagram helping to build out their shopping ecosystem and in the past I've worked at multiple startups and I wore many hats. I thrive when there are complex problems to solve and love a good software design :)

üë®‚Äçüíª I enjoy pushing myself outside my comfort zone to learn new things. In 2022 I spent time growing skills as a Tech Lead by advocating for and architecting a migration from our legacy curation system, and leading + mentoring engineers on the team in a couple big-bet projects. I also challenged myself to learn C++ in order to switch teams and start working on the new to me area of input systems in VR/AR.

In 2021 I learned a lot about **A/B Testing**, **Experiment Design and Analysis**, **Leading and Setting Team Direction**, and **Project Management**. Instagram published the shop tab in 2020 shortly after I joined the company. I worked to scale up the tab and find product market fit through the use of notifications and editorial content ever since.

‚õ∑ Outside of tech, I enjoy hanging out with my wife and 2 year-old son and boucing from hobby to hobby. Currently I am trying to get a grasp on electronics as it's the only hobby I can find that I like and that fits in a small apartment. In the past I have dabbled in woodworking going as far as to make a sub-par kitchen table for our house (my wife let us keep it for a year probably out of pity before ordering a nicer one).
I am also a big hockey, skiing, and hiking fan!

üìö I also love reading books for enjoyment and personal development. Recent books I'm a fan of include _Stories of your life and others - Ted Chiang_, _Snow Crash - Neal Stephenson_, _A Promised Land - Barack Obama_, _Sapiens - Yuval Noah Harari_, and _Staff Engineering - Will Larson_

‚úàÔ∏è My wife and I are big travellers having done an extended 6-month stay in Norway, travelling Europe, and most recently moving from Canada to NYC!
